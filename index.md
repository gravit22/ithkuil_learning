# Guide for learning Itkuil

## Learning grammar with special app
A dedicated app for practicing the grammar of the language was created.
 Since Ithkuil has much more grammatical units than any other language
  it is useful to practice it separately. 
 
 In this app, you can choose what slot to practice as well as morphemes
  to include in training. Currently, there are 2 seconds(will be adjustable
   manually) for the right answer, if it is in
 time then the probability of the current combination of morphemes will
  be shown less
 likely, and the opposite is true if the answer was given not in time. If
 probabilities of all combinations included in training will be less
 the certain threshold you will complete the training.
 
 Many more features are planned to be included. 
 Plans for features:
 - [x] separate grammar practice of different slots.
    - [ ] adding optional slots.
 - [ ] practice of pronunciation(writing correct IPA symbols corresponding
 to spelled grammar)
 - [ ] practicing of scope(translating Ithkuil to English and vise-versa 
 in drag and drop format)
 - [ ] practice of cases(where you give cases to English words without
 translating them)
 - [ ] adding native script when it is ready
 
 ## Memorising roots, affixes and grammar
 ### Find relations
 For simple memorization of roots and affixes, I recommend using mnemonics,
  which mean actually using any kind of visual rational wiring of two or
  more objects, concepts, etc. 
 #### Grammar
 Thanks to updating the language to became more regular, it became much
  easier to memorize grammar by finding relations inside it. For example,
  
 ![Standard vowel-form sequence](https://i.ibb.co/jvfCtp8/Screenshot-from-2021-04-10-13-13-44.png)
 
 - if you can notice in the first series every letter is followed by the
  latter with two dots on top of it. More than that it is followed by
   a similar letter in most cases. Also, the pattern flips in the middle
    around the "i" letter, so it 
  begins and ends with a letter without dots.
  - In series 3 you can see that for the first form 'i' transforms in 'o'
   and 'a' takes two dots. In the second form 'i' transforms to 'u' and
    'a' keeps dots(apparently there is no space for some more:smile:).
     The two next forms repeat the pattern.
  - In series 4 everything rotates 180 degrees and the first four forms
   are beginning with letters that end four last forms.
  In that way, you can search for relations everywhere else. 
 #### Roots and affixes
 For such abstract and alien letter combinations, such found in roots and 
  affixes, it is very useful to wire sounds with familiar sound in English
  or any other language, imagining a combination of two mental images.
  For example, let's take such an abstract and alien root like -kstw-
"mushroom", you find that lockstep contains the first three letters(sounds)
 of the root, and you can imagine mushrooms going in lockstep. It is okay
  to not include all the letters in the image, it will serve as a hint, so
     you can remind yourself of the rest with not so many problems. And
      images can be anything, they just need to have some visual, audial,
       or any other relations(similarities). 
 ### Repetition(using Anki or any other flashcard software)
 It is generally good practice to repeat the root or affix more often at
  the beginning of memorization. Pause between steps should be increased
   gradually. So steps(in minutes) like 1 3 10 30 300, can be a good choice,
   but can be anything you find works best for you. 
   
   If you do not remember the root you can try to remind yourself about
   relations you did for memorization, in many cases, it may be enough to 
   remind the whole root with stems.
   
   In one card I recommend include a root with stems altogether. Something
   like this:
   
  ![root](https://i.ibb.co/FbvT7Qs/Screenshot-from-2021-04-10-13-52-43.png)
  
  With only one side of the card - translating from Ithkuil to English.
    All the stems have relations by default, so it is probably not
     necessary to make cards for different stems, if you remind one,
      you probably remind all the others.
  
  For affixes, if affix contains gradation like -k≈£:
  
  ![affix](https://i.ibb.co/M6y1x38/Screenshot-from-2021-04-10-13-55-45.png)
  
  You need only include 3 forms in the card: 1, 5, 9 since all the others
  are in between those main forms. With others, it can be more complicated
  but with using tools demonstrated here you probably will be able to find
  optimal solution.
